- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well


# App Brainstorming

# 1. Netflix
    - Interactive: Hovering on a TV show or Movie gives the user multiple things to interact with such as a trailer, description, liking the show and adding it to the users list.
    - UI: Color choice keeps the attention of the user. The app doesnt make the user bored to look at it.
# 2. Instagram
    - Close Friends implementation (adding/removing selection of users to a whitelist)
    - Liking Instagram stories
# 3. Twitter
    - Pinning personal tweets to your profile
    - For you and following filter tabs for new tweets

# App Idea
SPOTIFY: 
  - Spotify is already a great app, but it can definitely be improved on. I've noticed that sometimes when I look at the lyrics to Nigerian music, the lyrics aren't correct. I've also noticed that a lot of the times the syncing of lyrics dont match up with the artists. I don't know exactly why that is, but I want to research this problem and find a solution. I compare spotify's lyrics feature with apple's and in my honest opinion, apple wins that battle. Even with this, Spotify is my preferred app to use. Because of this, I want to find any way to make my favorite music listening app better.
